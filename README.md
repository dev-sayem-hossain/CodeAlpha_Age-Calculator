# CodeAlpha_Age-Calculator
---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. User selects their **Date of Birth** using an HTML5 `<input type="date">`.
2. On form submission, the JavaScript:
   - Validates the input.
   - Uses the current date and selected birth date to calculate the time difference.
   - Adjusts for incomplete months and days.
3. Displays the result in a friendly format:
   > 🎉 You are 24 years, 3 months, and 17 days old.
